## Purpose
***
To develop a timed multiple-choice coding quiz which features dynamically updated HTML & CSS powered by JavaScript. It will run in the browser and have a clean polished, responsive user interface. 


&nbsp;


## Desired
***
A mock-up for functionality was given. This version applies that functionality, using a different appearance.

- When the start button is clicked, user is presented with a question.
- After the question is answered, another question appears.
- If a question is answered incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock.
- When all questions are answered or the timer reaches zero, the game is over.
- When the game is over, user can save intials and score.

## Other Notes
***
- I set userScore to 0 initially. Then calculated the score as userScore * 10 + the timeLeft.
- I have funciton checking if intials are characters A-Z; also have checking if null commented out. Not sure which I like better at the moment.
- I left console.logs in as reference; generally will take them out before deployment.
