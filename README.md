## Purpose
***
To develop a timed multiple-choice coding quiz which features dynamically updated HTML & CSS powered by JavaScript. It will run in the browser and have a clean polished, responsive user interface. 


&nbsp;


## Desired
***
A mock-up for functionality was given. This version applies that functionality, using a different appearance.

- When the start button is clicked, user is presented with a question.
- After the question is answered, another question appears.
- If a question is answered incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock.
- When all questions are answered orhte the timer reaches zero, the game is over.
- When the game is over, user can save intials an score.

## Other Notes
***
I set userScore to 0 initially.
Then calculated the score as userScore * 10 + the timeLeft
